# Customer Descriptive Statistics Analysis

## Objective
Analyze customer age data using descriptive statistics to understand data distribution before modeling.

## Dataset
- Source: Public customer dataset
- Rows: 50
- Columns: 5 (Age, Gender, Review, Education, Purchased)

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Statistics Covered
- Mean: 54.16
- Median: 57
- Mode: 74
- Variance: 658.34
- Standard Deviation: 25.66
- Range: 83
- IQR: 43.75

# Statistics Preview
- The mean and median are close, suggesting an approximately normal distribution.
- The relatively high standard deviation and variance indicate a wide spread of customer ages with no significant outliers.
- The interquartile range of 43.75 indicates a wide spread in the middle 50% of customer ages, suggesting a diverse customer base.
- The range of 83 highlights a very broad age span between the youngest and oldest customers.

## Key Insights
- Customer ages are centered around middle age.
- Median is more reliable than mean due to slight variation.
- Moderate spread indicates diverse age groups.

## Conclusion
This project strengthened my understanding of descriptive statistics and data interpretation before machine learning.

## Ethical Note
The dataset used in this project is publicly available and not created by me.
All analysis, interpretation, and code are my own work and done for educational purposes.
